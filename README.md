# stm32_ws2812b_disp
STM32 with display on WS2812B (demo project) 

 - Assume that we have STM32L152RB as MCU
 - Assume that we have CY8CMBR3108 as touch sensor (with 4 buttons)
 - Assume that we have something like RN4020 as BLE module over UART
 - Use WS2812B as running pixels with 750 leds
 - Use 20*5 WS2812B for display speed
